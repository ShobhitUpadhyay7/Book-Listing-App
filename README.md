# Book-Listing-App

This is a book listing app created using **React**, **Vite**, and **Firestore**.

It provides a minimal setup to get React working with Vite, including Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules for clean code.

Currently, two official Vite plugins are available for React:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) – uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) – uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
